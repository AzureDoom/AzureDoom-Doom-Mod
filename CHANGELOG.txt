v.3.9.0

- Rebalanced a few mobs health. 
- Complete rework done to all guns.
	- All Guns, Chain Saws and Crucible now use their durability as ammo, with all but the Crucible stopping at 1 durability. 
	- To reload the Guns, Chain Saws and Crucible, simple have their ammo in your main inventory* and press the Reload key.**
	- Super Shotgun now takes 2 durability per shot and requires you have at least 2 Shotgun Shells to reload and will not fire without at least 2 ammo in it.
	- Chain Saws no longer take damage when not hitting an entity.
- Started work on Doom related Strutures for 1.16 only. 

*Untested with any type of bag mod.
** Reload is bound to R by default but is configurable.
